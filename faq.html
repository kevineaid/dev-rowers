                                                        Pre-filter is a porous media commonly used to trap large or coarse dust particles/fibers. These large particles can be easily seen by naked eyes in sunlight. It is washable and helps increasing filter’s life.

                                                          In an air purifier a multilayer media helps in multiple purification process that are –
  1. Protection layer – It is a layer used at the outer side, on the side of the suction vent for the protection of other filter layers.
  2. Melt blown HEPA – It is a high efficiency Particulate air filter composes of a mat of randomly arranged fibres that traps 99.97% of dust(PM2.5), Smoke, Pet dander, Pollen grains.
  3. Activated Charcoal Granules – These act as resistance to harmful chemical fumes, gases and odour and traps them without releasing them back into the atmosphere.
  4. Substrate media – It is a filter that removes the basic sized dust and pollen grains form the air and acts as a supporting filter to the purifier.

                                                          You should place the air purifier in the room for the best results. It should be placed close to the height level of your spending the most time close. The air purifiers are mostly placed in living room and bedroom. Either it is for a business or a home use, it should be placed at the areas near to the place where you spend most of your time.

To ensure that your air purifier is performing its best, clean air filters are crucial. Change them when indicated.

                                                          Short for micrometer, a micron is one millionth of a meter and approximately 1/25,000th of an inch. Microns are used to measure airborne particle sizes. This is important because many harmful airborne particles are invisible to the naked eye, making them easily inhaled or distributed throughout your indoor environment. For example, dust mite allergens can be as small as 0.1 to 0.3 microns, which is considerably smaller than a single strand of human hair that typically measures 30 to 120 microns.

                                                          For best results, it is recommended to continuously run your air purifier. To help with noise and electricity costs, most air purifiers come with multiple cleaning speeds. For example, to maintain your indoor air quality while you
are away from home, your air purifier can be on a lower setting than when you are home. This saves energy and cuts costs while still maintaining a clean environment.

There are air cleaning systems available that can be installed to clean your entire house, however they tend to be more expensive than a portable unit. If an installed system is out of your budget, then portable air purifiers in key rooms are the way to go.

You should be able to breathe easier, sleep better, and experience less instances of morning congestion and allergy symptoms. When you change your filter, you will visually see how much filth it has been removing from your air.

                                                          There are two factors you need to take into consideration: the cost of the replacement filters and the annual electricity cost. High efficiency air purifiers generally use minimal electricity as they are engineered to be energy-saving. You can determine the annual operating cost by adding up the annual electricity cost and the filter replacement cost. Annual Electricity Cost = Power Consumption of the unit (Watt) x Rate of Electricity (Rs/kWh) x Hours of Operation.

                                                          No. An air purifier will not cure asthma or allergies. It will, however, help lessen the amount of pollutants in the air that you breathe, which in turn may provide you with some relief from the symptoms associated with these conditions. Air purifiers are not meant to act as a treatment or cure for any medical conditions. They are just another tool that you can utilize to improve the indoor air quality of your home or office. If you suffer from either of these conditions, you should seek medical attention immediately.

  That is why minimizing chemicals and toxins in your home is so important. With clean indoor air, common symptoms caused by indoor pollutants, such as itchy eyes, headaches, sore throat and dizziness can decrease.
  High concentrations of chemicals within the home originate from cleaning products, smokers in the home, pets that shed fur and dander, and airborne chemicals, such as VOC’s (volatile organic compound) and off-gassing from furniture and appliances.

Change of filter is dependent on both the quality and the usage conditions of the filter. Good quality filters last longer. Low-quality ones may require annual change. Again, the quality of air affects the life of the filter. In this case, high-quality filters may last up to 3 to 5 years.

Most of the air purifiers come with a built-in integrated timer that reminds you of filter change. Otherwise, one can leave this issue with the company itself by joining the list of replacement reminder team. The team will automatically inform you when the time for a filter change arrives.

Air purifiers are meant to be in operation, continuously. However, one may vary the speed at times. While you are not in the room switch it to faster speed otherwise switch over to the quiet mode of operation.
